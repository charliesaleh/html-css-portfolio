                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><small></small>Who I am</strong>
                <p>Good day, my name is Charlie Saleh. I was born on May 10, 2001 in Dearborn, Michigan. I am currently pursuing a career as a software engineer. I'm attending Henry Ford College with the intention of transferring to either Wayne State University 
                or Eastern Michigan University. In order to study and further my passion in coding, I am now enrolled in Coding Temple's bootcamp, which begins on January 30th, 2023.

                <h1>My Interests</h1>
                <strong><small></small>Reading, Watching, Cooking, and Hanging out with my friends.</strong>

                </figure>
                <p>My interests include reading books like as shonen manga, manwhas, and light novels, watching shows on Netflix, Crunchyroll, or HBO MAX, making various meals that I enjoy, and hanging out or playing video games with my friends whenever possible. 
                My two favorite series are Attack on Titan on Crunchyroll and The Last Kingdom on Netflix. Solo Leveling is my favorite tale to read (which will soon be adapted into an anime) since it has a terrific premise and is nicely designed. 
                Steaks served medium rare are without a doubt my favorite dish of all time. I enjoy both cooking and eating it, and I have yet to prepare and sample A5 Wagyu steak from Japan, which I plan to do soon. 
                Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of my favorite games to play since it has gorgeous gameplay and graphics, as well as a wonderful plot. I hang out with my friends whenever I have the chance, and there is never a dull day when we get together.

                <h1>My Goals for the Future</h1>
                <strong><small></small>To transform my life and the lives of my family members.</strong>
                <p>I've been living in a one bedroom and one bedroom apartment with a family of four since I was a child, and I've seen my parents suffer throughout their lives paying expenses just so my sister and I could have a wonderful life, for which I will be
                eternally thankful. It's now my turn to reciprocate their generosity. My ambition is to become a professional software engineer in order to financially support myself and my family. I want to buy a property for myself and my parents so they may move about 
                freely and comfortably. These are goals I want to achieve, but I'm going to start with Coding Temple so I can get that done before moving on to other things.

                <h1>My Favorite Quote</h1>
                <strong><small></small>Eren Jeager:</strong>
                <p>"Everyday I've spent here, I've wondered.
                    How did all these people let it come to this?
                    Minds and bodies ruined.
                    Dreams of freedom erased.
                    Personalities burned away.
                    No one would wanna go to war.
                    If they knew what it would do to them.
                    But it's not like we all leapt into that hell knowingly.
                    Most of us were pushed.
                    Some of us were pushed by other people.
                    And some of us were pushed by the environments we grew up in.
                    So....
                    A few who do choose to leap in the hell see it differently than us.
                    And they are also able to see something beyond the hell.
                    Maybe that something is hope.
                    Or maybe it's just another hell.
                    Fact is...
                    You can only find out by moving forward."
